3.3.0   2016-10-04

No longer compatible with Dancer2 prior to plugin2 release.

3.2.2	2015-12-30
    [ D2P2 ]
Compatible with the new Dancer2::Plugin2

3.0.2	2015-03-10
    [ NICE! ]
Move plugin_setting to on_plugin_import.
This makes $dsl->passphrase callable from other plugins!

3.0.1	2015-03-09
    [ MISC ]
Removed some leftovers.

3.0.0	2015-03-09

    [ Remove AUTO STRINGIFICATION ]
This version looks like 2.0.5 :)

2.0.6   2014-12-16

    [ AUTO STRINGIFICATION IS DEPRECATED ]
This version brings back the overloading but it will carp!
You must use $phrase->rfc2307() to get a text string.

2.0.5   2014-12-12

    [ Sawyer X ]
 Major cleanup: it works now:

The original structure was awkward. This is fixed and working with
the original tests.

There are now three decoupled parts:

* Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase:

Provide the 'generate' keyword for generating passphrases.

* Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase::Core:

The majority of the actual implementation.

When you call the 'generate' keyword it creates an object of
Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase::Core. The original design would actually
create an object of the plugin itself, which is risky and confusing.

When you call methods, it's actually called on this object.

* Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase::Hashed:

This is a data object representing the hashed passphrase.

2.0.4   2014-11-22

    [ MISC ]
    * New Makfile

2.0.3	2014-11-10

   [ MISC ]
